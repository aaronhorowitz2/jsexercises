<h2>PSE JS Exercises</h2>

Hello PSEs! 

Below you’ll find three sets of JavaScript exercises designed to introduce you to the language and assess some foundational skills. If you are not already familiar with JavaScript, please take a look at the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iSzCEFVHvc_2s_I5tpAx-gKeIe7Y5hzIwj6tvxVahEQ/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">JS Topics sheet</a>, where you’ll find a ton of valuable resources for getting started with JS. 

Once you’re ready, go through these exercises in order, and reach out to Aaron or Jonathan if you have any questions or get stuck!

<h3>Section 1: Codewars</h3>

Create a <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/sign_in" target="_blank">Codewars account</a> so that you’ll be able to do these exercises on the Codewars platform. You can sign in with Github to make things easy!  

<strong>Submitting answers</strong>: Codewars has pre-populated tests for you to run through your algorithms, so that you can check your code first with a few basic inputs, and then with more varied inputs and edge cases. Once you’ve passed all tests, consider your algorithm correct, and <strong>save the algorithm in a .js file.</strong>

<a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/you-only-need-one-beginner/train/javascript" target="_blank">Algorithm Problem 1</a>

Hint: google javascript methods for array containing a value

<a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/stringy-strings/train/javascript" target="_blank">Algorithm Problem 2</a>

Hint: string append method

<a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/vowel-count/train/javascript" target="_blank">Algorithm Problem 3</a>

Hint: use conditional logic (if/else)


<h3>Section 2: DOM Manipulation</h3>

This section involves updating and manipulating a website. 

Clone down the three files in this repo - jsexercise.html, jsstyle.css, and app.js - and keep them in the same directory on your laptop. All necessary CSS classes have been created for you, so you’ll only need to modify the JS file, as well as the HTML file if you go for the extra credit stretch problem for #3.

<ol>
<li>Add functionality such that, when a user mouses over the second square, the third square disappears. 
<br>
(Hint: event listeners)
<br>
--Stretch: when the user mouses over the second square again, the third square should reappear.</li>
<br>
<li>Add functionality to change the first square’s fill color to red, and change its border color to blue, when a user clicks on the square.
<br>
--Stretch: when the user clicks on the square again, the colors should revert back to the original display. 

--Super stretch: limit this functionality to four total clicks, such that when the user clicks on the square a fifth time, nothing happens.</li>
<br>
<li>Display an accurate count of the number of times the button has been clicked.
<br>
--Super extra credit stretch: add a button that reduces the click count every time it is clicked.</li>
</ol>
